# Data Visualization

This repository contains partial source code of the `System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization` namespace that provides charting for WinForms. We ported and open sourced those components to enable charting features for WinForms applications that are developed on .NET Core 3.

**This repo is read-only**. We consider the `System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization` deprecated and we only provide it to ease porting to .NET Core 3. We're not going to innovate in this component and subsequently will not accept any PRs.
